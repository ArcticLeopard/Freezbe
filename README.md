# Freezbe
Application for managing assignments and projects.<br>
Designed to assist users in organizing their responsibilities, schedules, and projects efficiently.

## Motivation
The application is being developed for the purposes of the "**100 Commits**" Contest.<br>
The main motivations for participating in the contest for me are the following factors:
- Creating a product that I will use.
- Practicing consistency.
- Practicing Reverse Engineering.
- Expanding my technological stack with new technologies.
- Adding an interesting entry to my CV.
